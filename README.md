# üè†‚ö° Power Load Balancer

A Home Assistant custom integration to prevent exceeding your household's power budget by automatically turning off less critical appliances based on real-time power consumption.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Monitors the total house power consumption from a main sensor.
-   Compares current usage against a configured power budget.
-   Automatically turns off pre-defined controllable appliances when the budget is exceeded.
-   Allows configuring multiple monitored circuits/sensors, each linked to a controllable appliance.
-   Prioritize which appliances to turn off based on configured importance levels.
-   Flag certain appliances as "last resort" to only turn them off if absolutely necessary.
-   Optional "assumed power on" value for appliances to react quickly to potential overloads before sensor data updates.
-   Provides a control switch entity to easily enable or disable the load balancing function.
-   Includes a sensor entity to log balancing events (e.g., which appliance was turned off and why).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

-   Home Assistant (version 202X.X or later is recommended).
-   Power sensors integrated into Home Assistant that provide real-time power consumption (in Watts).
-   Controllable switches or light entities integrated into Home Assistant for the appliances you want to manage.
-   HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) is recommended for easier installation and updates.

## üíæ Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1.  In Home Assistant, navigate to **HACS -> Integrations**.
2.  Click the three dots in the top right corner and select **"Custom repositories"**.
3.  Add the URL of **your GitHub repository** for this integration.
4.  Select the category **"Integration"**.
5.  Click **"Add"**.
6.  Search for "Power Load Balancer" in the HACS Integrations list.
7.  Click on the integration, then click **"Download"**.
8.  Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1.  Navigate to your Home Assistant configuration directory (where your `configuration.yaml` is located).
2.  Create a `custom_components` directory if it doesn't exist.
3.  Clone this repository or download the contents and place the `power_load_balancer` folder inside the `custom_components` directory.
    ```bash
    # Example using git clone
    cd /path/to/your_config_dir
    mkdir custom_components
    cd custom_components
    git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/power_load_balancer.git
    ```
4.  Rename the cloned directory to `power_load_balancer` if applicable.
5.  Restart Home Assistant.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation and restart:

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings -> Devices & Services**.
2.  Click the orange **"+ ADD INTEGRATION"** button.
3.  Search for "Power Load Balancer".
4.  Follow the steps in the configuration flow:
    *   **Main Configuration:**
        *   Select your **Main Power Sensor** (the sensor representing the total house consumption).
        *   Enter your **Power Budget (Watt)**.
    *   **Add New Monitored Sensor:**
        *   Select a **Power Sensor** for a specific appliance or circuit you want to monitor.
        *   Optionally provide a **Name** for this configuration (defaults to the sensor's friendly name).
        *   Set the **Importance** (1 being highest priority to keep on, 10 being lowest priority).
        *   Check the **Last Resort** box if this appliance should only be turned off as a last resort.
        *   Select the **Controllable Appliance** (switch or light entity) associated with this sensor.
        *   Optionally enter the **Assumed Power On Consumption (Watt)** for this appliance on startup.
    *   You can add multiple monitored sensors and their associated appliances.
    *   You can remove configured sensors from the main configuration screen.
    *   Select **"Finish Configuration"** when done.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

Once configured, the integration will automatically monitor your power usage and trigger balancing actions when the budget is exceeded and balancing is enabled.

-   **Control Switch:** A switch entity named `switch.power_load_balancer_control_switch` (or similar depending on the automatic entity ID generation) will be created. You can use this switch to manually enable or disable the automatic load balancing function.
-   **Event Log Sensor:** A sensor entity named `sensor.power_load_balancer_event_log` (or similar) will be created. The state will show the last balancing action, and the `events` attribute will contain a list of recent balancing events (e.g., when appliances were turned off).

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

-   **Balancing Not Happening:**
    *   Check if the "Power Load Balancer Control" switch is turned **on**.
    *   Verify that your power sensors are reporting data correctly.
    *   Check the Home Assistant logs for any errors related to `power_load_balancer`.
    *   Check the "Power Load Balancer Log" sensor for any error messages or indications of actions taken.
    *   Ensure the configured main power sensor and monitored sensors are reporting in Watts.
-   **Appliance Not Turning Off:**
    *   Verify the correct controllable appliance entity is selected in the configuration.
    *   Check if the appliance was already turned off by the balancer (it won't try to turn it off again).
    *   Ensure the appliance is not marked as "Last Resort" if other, higher importance appliances are still on.
